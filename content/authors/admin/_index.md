I am a PhD Candidate in Economics on the 2025-2026 job market!

I am broadly interested in health and labor economics, and my current research agenda is centered around whether opioid legislation has been effective in targeting internalities and externalities of the opioid epidemic.

My job market paper explores expansion in access to an opioid overdose reversal drug and whether it creates a moral hazard for opioid users.
